# Crowd — N-of-M Escrow on BSV

Crowd is a browser-only React app that lets anyone lock BSV into an on-chain N-of-M multisig escrow, assign a group of controllers by identity, and coordinate the release (or cancellation) entirely through encrypted peer-to-peer messages — no custom backend required. The originator picks M controllers, sets a threshold N, funds the escrow from their BRC-100 wallet, and shares a link. Each controller can propose a recipient, sign or veto proposals, and the escrow broadcasts automatically once N valid signatures are collected. The originator can unilaterally cancel at any time, recovering funds back to their own wallet.

## How it works

### Locking script

The escrow output uses a custom `CrowdEscrow` script template with two spending paths:

```
OP_IF
  OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <hash160(concat(pubkeys))> OP_EQUALVERIFY
  <threshold> OP_SWAP
  (<33> OP_SPLIT) × (total−1)
  <total> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
OP_ELSE
  OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <hash160(refundPubKey)> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```

**Multisig path** (`OP_1` selector): authenticates the concatenated-pubkeys blob against a committed hash, splits it into individual 33-byte compressed keys, then runs `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`. Unlocking: `OP_0 <sig_0> … <sig_{N-1}> <concat(pubkeys)> OP_1`.

**Cancel path** (`OP_0` selector): standard P2PKH check against the originator's derived refund key. Unlocking: `<sig> <refundPubKey> OP_0`.

Sighash: `SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_FORKID`, subscript = full locking script.

### Key derivation

**Multisig keys (BRC-42):** when creating an escrow, the originator calls `wallet.getPublicKey({ protocolID: [1, 'multi sig brc29'], keyID, counterparty: controllerIdentityKey })` for each controller, using a random base64 `keyID` nonce generated per escrow. The originator's own key uses `counterparty: 'self'`. Controllers later sign with `wallet.createSignature({ protocolID: [1, 'multi sig brc29'], keyID, counterparty: originatorIdentityKey, hashToDirectlySign })`, exploiting BRC-42 symmetry so both sides derive the same shared key.

**Refund key (BRC-29):** `wallet.getPublicKey({ protocolID: [2, '3241645161d8'], keyID: \`${prefix} ${suffix}\`, counterparty: 'self' })` where `prefix` and `suffix` are random base64 nonces stored in the wallet's `customInstructions` for the escrow output (basket `crowd escrow`). The cancel spend re-derives the same key; funds return as wallet change.

### Coordination via MessageBox

All messages are JSON (auto-encrypted per recipient by `@bsv/message-box-client`), sent fan-out to every participant (originator + all controllers). The host is `https://gmb.bsvblockchain.tech`, box name `crowd`.

| Message type  | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `invite`      | Escrow created — carries `escrowId` (`txid.vout`), AtomicBEEF of the funding tx, `satoshis`, `threshold`, `keyID`, controller identity keys, derived multisig pubkeys, and the refund PKH. |
| `proposal`    | Spend draft — carries the unsigned spending transaction (`rawTx` hex), proposed outputs with notes, and optional BRC-29 derivation info for the recipient. |
| `signature`   | A single controller's checksig-format ECDSA signature over the proposal sighash. |
| `veto`        | Any controller rejects the proposal (optional reason). UI removes the proposal; no script effect. |
| `finalized`   | Broadcast succeeded — carries the resulting `txid`. |
| `cancelled`   | Originator cancelled the escrow via the refund path — carries the `txid`. |

Clients load state on startup via `listMessages({ messageBox: 'crowd' })` and stay live with `listenForLiveMessages`. Acknowledged messages are persisted to `localStorage` keyed by the user's own identity key.

### Share links

Invite link: `/#/e/<escrowId>?d=<base64url(invite payload)>` — anyone with the link and a wallet can view the escrow; only listed controllers can sign.

Proposal link: `/#/p/<escrowId>/<proposalId>` — data is resolved from the holder's inbox or local store.

## Running

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

A [BRC-100](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/BRCs/blob/master/wallet/0100.md)-compatible wallet must be running locally (e.g. [Metanet Desktop](https://metanet.io/)). The app connects to it automatically; a full-screen gate appears until the wallet is reachable.

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Security notes

- **Veto is cooperative, not script-enforced.** Any controller can broadcast a finalize transaction even after a veto message — the veto is a UI-level consensus signal only. The script only enforces that N valid signatures are present.
- **Finalize races are benign.** If multiple clients observe the threshold simultaneously and each broadcasts, they are all spending the same UTXO: only one will be accepted by the network. The first confirmed broadcast wins; the rest are double-spend failures.
- **The refund path is originator-only.** The cancel unlocking script requires a signature from the BRC-29 key derived to `counterparty: 'self'` with nonces stored only in the originator's wallet. No other party can produce a valid cancel signature.
- **Signatures are verified client-side before counting.** `verifySignature` in `escrow.ts` checks each incoming `signature` message against the expected BRC-42 derived public key before including it in the threshold count. Invalid or mis-attributed signatures are silently ignored.
